For this kata you will have to forget how to add two numbers.

It can be best explained using the following meme:

In simple terms, our method does not like the principle of carrying over numbers and just writes down every number it calculates :-)

You may assume both integers are positive integers.


function add(num1, num2) {
  const arr1 = Array.from(String(num1), Number);
  const arr2 = Array.from(String(num2), Number);

  const res = [];
  let i = Math.max(arr1.length, arr2.length);
  while (i >= 1) {
    res.push((arr1[arr1.length-i] || 0) + (arr2[arr2.length-i] || 0));
    i--;
  }
  return +res.join('');
}
